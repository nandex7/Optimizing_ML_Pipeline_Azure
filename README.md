# Optimizing an ML Pipeline in Azure

## Overview
This project is part of the Udacity Azure ML Nanodegree.
In this project, we build and optimize an Azure ML pipeline using the Python SDK and a provided Scikit-learn model.
This model is then compared to an Azure AutoML run.

## Summary

Data set used for this project https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bank+Marketing contains the information from Portuguese Bank Marketing. The informations is based on phone calls and We want to predict if the client has suscribed a term deposit. Based to Age, type of job, marital, education, has credit in defualt, housing, loan, type of contact , last contact, day of the week of the contact, 
duration in seconds, campaigns, and other variables  

The best performance model was the algorithm Voting Ensemble found using AutoMl.The accuracy was of 0.91988 .
Regarding the method using python with Hyperdrive gives an accuracy of 0.910

## Scikit-learn Pipeline

**Explain the pipeline architecture, including data, hyperparameter tuning, and classification algorithm.**

**What are the benefits of the parameter sampler you chose?**

**What are the benefits of the early stopping policy you chose?**

## AutoML
**In 1-2 sentences, describe the model and hyperparameters generated by AutoML.**

## Pipeline comparison
**Compare the two models and their performance. What are the differences in accuracy? In architecture? If there was a difference, why do you think there was one?**

## Future work
**What are some areas of improvement for future experiments? Why might these improvements help the model?**
